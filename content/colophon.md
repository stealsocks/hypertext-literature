description: What this site is made of.

Like most of my sites, this one was built with Hugo, with the data stored as a TOML file where entries look something like this: 

```toml
[[authors]]
name = " Aaron Swartz"
blog = " Raw Thought "
link = "http://www.aaronsw.com"
color = '#ff4'
posts = [
	'[ A Non-Programmerâ€™s Apology](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nonapology)', 
	'[ I Hate the News](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews)', 
	'[ Take the Easy Way Out](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/easywayout)', 
	'[ HOWTO: Be More Productive](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity)', 
	'[ Two Conceptions of Taste](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2taste)']
]
```
